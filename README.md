**Why are we doing this?** 

To develop our front end skills and create a CRUD app. 

**How I expected the challenge to go** 

I expected the challenge to be difficult but a good learning process

**What went well?** 

I was able to solve issues as I came across them which helped with my learning.

**What didn't go as planned?** 

Components did not render as I expected them to but after reading into immutable states I was able to fix the issue.

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.** 

Adding character/input checks to the edit and add record modals if the inputs had a specific format to be followed.
